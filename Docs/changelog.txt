TODO: Add every open source game you can think of - save for updates
TODO: Assassin's Creed 2 and other stuff like that
TODO: Confirm new restore code properly handles being denied write access
TODO: Add logging for all errors and messages?
TODO: Double check appdata priorities
0.9.1 - Independent Evolution
* Added client code for the new automatically generating update server
0.9 - Beta in mind
* Change Analyzer to disable entire interface while e-mailing
* Changed analyzer to e-mail masgausubmissions@gmail.com instead of my personal address
* Added startup check to monitor to exit the program if a detected monitor is already running.
* Settings are automatically shared between running programs
* Restore process overhauled, including ability to select specific files to restore
* Added the ability to mass-restore easily
* Entire interface re-written (But it still looks pretty much the same! Progress!)
* Monitor settings overhauled, right click menu much smaller and tidier
* Added the ability to do an automatic mass-restore
* Added ability to edit reports before sending/saving them
* Added a flashshare environemtn variable for flash games
* Changed the restore process to create a temp file (which is ignored by DropBox), and works on that file, then copies the temp file over the original file (or converts the old one to a revision copy if that setting is enabled).
* Added new modified_after attribute to the save, ignore and identifier tags.
* Stuff
* Little things
* Big things
* SUPPORT FOR DAIKATANA! BOOYAH!
v.0.8 - Beta in spirit
* Added a contribution counter to the about tab. So cool.
* Added the ability to sort the games list both ascending and descending
* Fixed detection of Playstation saves on memory sticks formatted as "FAT" (Fix contributed by duncans_pumpkin)
* Moved the populating of the main interface elements to the shown event handler to prevent potential synchronization issues, which unfortuantely means it takes longer for the interface to enable
* Changed game_data XML element to just game
* Changed target framework to .NET 4.0
* Added more advanced XML validation for better error feedback
* Added an XSD for the game data XML format
* Shifted a while loop so that a duplicate game name does not necessarily prevent further game detection
* Added the ability to detect saves that are actually just in the root of a relative path
* Added %ALTSAVEPATHS% for saves that could be anywhere
* Added %STEAMSOURCEMODS% to point to Steam/steamapps/SourceMods
* Changed Analyzer to convert paths to lowercase to ensure matches while scanning the registry and the s0tart menu
* Adjusted relative path detection so that all path names come right from the file system
* Changed detected roots for a game to be stored in a Dictionary instead of an ArrayList to help prevent identical duplicates
* Changed naming convention so mods have a ?then the name of the game they are modding
* Stopped MASGAU Monitor from being bi-polar (flashing Danger Will Robinson / Safety Will Robinson)
* Added a precaution to MASGAU Monitor in case duplicate save paths are passed to it
* Changed Path Handler so that both VirtualStore and the real Program Files will always be checked regardless of UAC status, which should help accomodate old games that may or may not be running as Admin
* Changed the backup detection portion of startup to use the progress bar, as this step can take a while if you have enough backups
* Fixed appending of root path to file name when making a custom archive
* Changed custom archives to automatically have a timestamp appended to the name
* Changed monitor's tooltip to always have the right plural 
* Added the option to Monitor (which will be on by default) to perform a full backup on startup. This is to prevent some files from going undetected just because they were made while Monitor wasn't running.
* Addeed a check so Monitor will prompt for a backup path if one is not set
* Rearranged the tabs in order of most frequently used (IMHO)
* Moved game data XML files to a subfolder so they won't interfere with other xml files
* Added the ability to update game definitions via auto-check or by pushing a button on the settings tab
* Fixed a couple cross-thread calls
* Fixed a bug when restoring a game to an %INSTALLLOCATION% path. Which pretty much means all of them. Sorry guys, my bad.
* Fixed a mistake that caused the "Use This" button to actually cancel a restore. I need to have my head examined.
* Changed 7z.exe finder to first check in the install folder - this is prepping for a portable version
* Changed config path thinger to first check in the install folder - see above
* Switched installer to Inno Setup
* Changed registry manager to be able to see 64-bit context even in 32-bit, thus removing the need for 64-bit builds
* Fixed being able to see the 64-bit Program Files folder
* A couple other things that I forgot about because my computer crashed and corrupted the changelog
* Added errors for when a registry key root isn't recognized, and when a relative root isn't recognized, and when there's a space in a game name
* Added all settings to Monitor, so you don't have to fire up the main program if you don't want to
* Added locks to settings manager to prevent two threads from modifying the config file simultaneously
* Changed XML definition to use location instead of root
* Added environment_variable attribute to location tags, not more of that %% stuff
* Changed registry attribute to registry_root and registry_key
* Some massive internal overhauling to accomodate the above 3 changes and generally make the whole detection process a lot cleaner
* Finally got everything in the same namespace
* Created portable version
* Added support for an ignore tag
* Added button to e-mail reports straight from the analyzer
* Changed the detected games list to be tile view
* Fixed a bug that allowed the same file to be detected twice
* Added a comment box to the analyzer
* Added support for games that use Steam's userdata folder
* Fixed a crash when trying to restore a game with a name MASGAU doesn't know
* Added an alert when a new version of MASGAU is available
* A bunch of other things that I didn't keep track of
